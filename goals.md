# Astro 497, Lab 1, Exercise 2

## Goal: Reflect on your goals for the semester

## Instructions
- Open and edit the file named `goals.md` in your lab 1 repository.
- Using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), create headings for two sections "My Experience" and "My Goals".
- Under My Experiences
   - Write one paragraph (1-5 sentences) about any previous experience you have related to data sciences and exoplanets.
   - Include a working link somewhere in the paragraph.
- Under My Goals
  - Create a bulleted list of 2 or 3 goals for you to work towards during this course.
  - Create a bulleted list of 3-9 specific objectives for you to achieve during this course.
  
- Commit the file to your local respository and push it to your github repository, so it will be included in the pull request you create to submit your assignment.  (See [tips](http://psuastro497.github.io/Fall2022/tips/labs/) for committing changes and submitting a lab.)
- Once you've pushed your code to GitHub, view a rendered version of your file on GitHub to make sure the formatting is as you intended.
